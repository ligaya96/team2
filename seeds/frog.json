    "description": "The Green and Black Dart Frog is a species of Poison Dart family. This species is found in Central and South America and thrives on the rainforest floor. These little frogs are usually a green and black color. It is their bright colors that warn predators of their poison glands. Their name can sometimes keep beginners from adopting them. But surprisingly they make a great beginner frog. These frogs are small, entertaining and energetic. They are normally searching for food and hopping around â€“ one of their favorite foods is ants. A committed beginner can care for one provided they are aware of the risks of handling one.",
