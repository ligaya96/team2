            <h2>Frogs</h2>
            <p>
                A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of
                short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura. The
                oldest fossil "proto-frog" appeared in the early Triassic of
                Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may
                extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.

            <h2>Lizards</h2>
            <p>
                Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000
                species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as
                most oceanic island chains. Lizards range in size from chameleons
                and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.

            <h2>Snakes</h2>
            <p>
                Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder
                Serpentes. Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote
                vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes
                have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors,
                enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with
                their highly mobile jaws.

            <h2>Turtles</h2>
            <p>
                Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonia or Testudines. They are
                characterized by a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed
                from their ribs that acts as a shield. Colloquially, the word
                "turtle" is generally restricted to fresh-water and sea-dwelling
                Testudines.
